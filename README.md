 Session 2

Overview

This session focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to **EVALI (E-cigarette or Vaping Use-Associated Lung Injury)**. The objective is to explore the dataset, clean and transform it, and extract meaningful insights through descriptive statistics and visualizations.

---

Key Topics Covered

1. **Dataset Exploration**:
   - Loading data into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Inspecting the structure and contents of the dataset.
   - Identifying missing or inconsistent values.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing data.
   - Transforming and standardizing columns for analysis.

3. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Generating descriptive statistics to summarize key metrics.
   - Visualizing trends and distributions using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

4. **Insight Extraction**:
   - Drawing conclusions about patterns and trends in the EVALI dataset.

Exercises

The exercises in this session involve working through a dataset to achieve the following:

1. Data Exploration
Understand the structure and content of the dataset.
  - Use `df.info()` and `df.describe()` to summarize the data.
  - Identify columns with missing or irrelevant data for cleaning.

2. Data Cleaning
Prepare the data for analysis by handling inconsistencies.
  - Fill missing values with appropriate statistics or placeholders.
  - Normalize column names for consistency.

3. Descriptive Statistics
 Summarize key metrics in the dataset.
  - Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode) for numeric columns.
  - Group data by key categories (e.g., age, gender, or location) to calculate aggregated metrics.

4. Visualizations
 Generate insights using visual tools.
  - Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of a key variable (e.g., age or cases per location).
  - Use a lineplot to show trends over time.
  - Generate a barplot to compare categories (e.g., gender or region-based cases).
