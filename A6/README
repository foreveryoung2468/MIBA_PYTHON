 Session 6: Exploring and Cleaning Data with Pandas

 Overview

This repository contains materials and exercises from **Session 6**, focusing on the use of the Pandas library for data analysis and preprocessing. The exercises cover a range of real-world data scenarios, including cleaning, transforming, and summarizing datasets.


Topics Covered

1. Introduction to Pandas:
   - Understanding `DataFrame` and `Series`.
   - Overview of Pandas' capabilities in handling 1D and 2D data structures.

2. Loading and Exploring Datasets:
   - Reading datasets from different file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel).
   - Exploring data with descriptive statistics and initial analysis.

3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing data.
   - Filtering and transforming data.
   - Grouping and aggregating.
   - Merging and joining datasets.
   - Reshaping datasets.

Key Features of Pandas

Pandas provides extensive tools for data manipulation and analysis, including:
- Missing Data Handling: Identify and fill or drop missing values.
- DataFrame Resizing: Add or remove rows and columns.
- Group and Aggregate Operations: Summarize and analyze subsets of data.
- Advanced Indexing: Slice, filter, and locate data with complex conditions.
- Time Series Manipulation: Analyze and transform time-based data.
- Data Integration: Merge, join, and concatenate datasets.
- Data Export: Read/write data to/from formats like CSV, Excel, and HDF5.

Exercises

Netflix Dataset Exercises

1. **Is there any missing rating?**
   - **Objective**: Identify rows with missing values in the `rating` column.
   - **Method**: Use Pandas' `isnull()` and `sum()` functions to count missing values.

2. **How many films in 2021 correspond to your country?**
   - **Objective**: Filter movies released in 2021 and produced in a specific country.
   - **Method**: Use `query()` or filtering operations on the `release_year` and `country` columns.

3. **What's the number of movies in 2020 with full information?**
   - **Objective**: Count movies from 2020 with no missing values in any column.
   - **Method**: Use `dropna()` to remove rows with missing data, then filter by year.

4. **Give me the year with more titles.**
   - **Objective**: Find the year with the highest number of movie releases.
   - **Method**: Group data by `release_year`, use `size()` to count titles, and identify the year with the maximum count.

5. **What has been the average number of releases from 2010?**
   - **Objective**: Calculate the average number of titles released per year since 2010.
   - **Method**: Filter years >= 2010, group by year, and calculate the mean using `groupby()` and `mean()`.

Titanic Dataset Exercises

1. **Calculate Gender-Based Survival Percentage**:
   - **Objective**: Compute the survival rate for each gender.
   - **Method**: Group data by `gender`, then calculate the ratio of survivors to total passengers using `groupby()` and aggregation functions.

2. **Calculate Survival Percentage Grouped by Gender and Class**:
   - **Objective**: Analyze survival rates across gender and passenger class.
   - **Method**: Perform a multi-level group-by operation on `gender` and `class`, then compute the survival rate for each combination.
