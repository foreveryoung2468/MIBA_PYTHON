# Session 4: Advanced Data Processing and Analysis

## Overview

This session focuses on advanced data processing and analysis techniques using Python. It includes practical exercises designed to enhance your skills in handling real-world data, transforming it for analysis, and extracting meaningful insights.

---

## Key Topics Covered

1. **File Handling and Data Formats**:
   - Reading and writing data in formats like JSON, Pickle, and Parquet.
   - Understanding use cases and advantages of each format.

2. **Regular Expressions (re)**:
   - Using the `re` library to extract patterns from text.
   - Practical applications in parsing filenames and cleaning string data.

3. **Date and Time Manipulation**:
   - Leveraging the `datetime` library to process and analyze date-time data.
   - Generating time-based summaries and aggregations.

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - Grouping and summarizing data.
   - Identifying trends and patterns in datasets.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Libraries: `re`, `datetime`, `json`, `pickle`

### Steps to Execute
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/session-4-data-processing.git

## Insights

1. **Month with the Most Annotations**:
   - The month with the highest number of annotations can be easily identified using the grouped data.

2. **Annotation Distribution**:
   - The JSON and Pickle dictionaries provide efficient ways to store and retrieve data for specific months.

3. **Chronological Order**:
   - Sorting annotations allows for chronological insights, which can be useful for time-series analysis or tracking changes over time.
