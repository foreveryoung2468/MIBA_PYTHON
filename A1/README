Session 1: Introduction to Data Analysis with Python

Overview

This session provides a foundational introduction to data analysis using Python. The session focuses on understanding the basics of data structures, loading datasets, and performing simple transformations and analyses. It serves as a stepping stone for more advanced topics in subsequent sessions.

Key Topics Covered

1. **Getting Started with Python**:
   - Overview of Python's role in data analysis.
   - Key libraries used in data analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

2. **Working with DataFrames**:
   - Understanding the Pandas DataFrame structure.
   - Loading datasets into a DataFrame from CSV, Excel, or other file formats.
   - Inspecting, summarizing, and manipulating data.

3. **Basic Data Operations**:
   - Selecting, filtering, and indexing data.
   - Performing simple transformations such as adding new columns or modifying existing ones.

4. **Simple Visualizations**:
   - Using Matplotlib for basic visualizations such as line charts and histograms.
   - Customizing plots with titles, labels, and legends.

Exercise Details

The exercises focus on applying the foundational concepts covered in this session:

1. **Loading and Inspecting Data**:
   - Load a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Inspect the first few rows of the dataset using `head()` and summarize the dataset with `info()` and `describe()`.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Create a new column `professor_initials` that stores the initials of each professor's first and last names.
   - Extract the last name of each professor and store it in a new column `professor_last_name`.

Insights from the Exercises

1. **New Columns Added**:
   - The `professor_initials` column provides a quick reference for professor names.
   - The `professor_last_name` column allows easy access to surnames.

2. **DataFrame Manipulation**:
   - Showcases how to transform string-based columns into useful features.
